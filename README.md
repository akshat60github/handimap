Hi-Fi,etc made on Figma for Human-Computer Interaction Course (IIIT-D) : HandiMap

HandiMap is a navigation app designed to improve accessibility for individuals with mobility challenges. Using Figma, I created high-fidelity designs to ensure an intuitive, user-friendly, and visually optimized experience. The app focuses on providing wheelchair-friendly routes, step-free access points, and landmark-based navigation to make travel easier and more inclusive.

Every design decision was made with accessibility in mind, incorporating clear visuals, easy-to-use interfaces, and customizable preferences to cater to different mobility needs. HandiMap aims to empower users by offering reliable, efficient, and inclusive navigation solutions that enhance everyday mobility.
